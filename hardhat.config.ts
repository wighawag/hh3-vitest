   * The `networks` configuration is mostly compatible with Hardhat 2.
   * The key differences right now are:
   *
   * - You must set a `type` for each network, which is either `http` or `edr`,
   *   allowing you to have multiple simulated networks.
   *
   * - You can set a `chainType` for each network, which is either `generic`,
   *   `l1`, or `optimism`. This has two uses. It ensures that you always
   *   connect to the network with the right Chain Type. And, on `edr`
   *   networks, it makes sure that the simulated chain behaves exactly like the
   *   real one. More information about this can be found in the test files.
   *
   * - The `accounts` field of `http` networks can also receive Configuration
   *   Variables, which are values that only get loaded when needed. This allows
   *   Hardhat to still run despite some of its config not being available
   *   (e.g., a missing private key or API key). More info about this can be
   *   found in the "Sending a Transaction to Optimism Sepolia" of the README.
